This is basicly what my MUD looked like when it was shutdown in the summer 
of 2001 (due to lack of time to maintain it). This means that the code 
contains much halfdone/halfbaked code as well as messy stuff here and 
there which was never intended to stay for long. If you want to make a 
successful and stable MUD, I suggest getting the dystopia 1.4 codebase, 
which is also based on this code (but with cleanups, better documentation 
and a stabler code). On the other hand, if you just want to start a MUD 
and play around, I guess this is a decent way to do it - just don't get 
surprised when stuff stops working, monsters explode at random and other 
nasty stuff (consider yourself warned). I take no responsibility for any 
harm this code may cause to anyone reading it.

At the time of this release, I have not looked at this mess for 2 years, 
so I'm most likely unable to answer any questions you may have. I have 
since moved on and begun work on something much more worthwhile (visit the 
SocketMud(tm) website for details - http://www.socketmud.dk/)
